# Leaflet Challenge
In this assignment I added layers to a map concerning earthquakes. The size of the circles changes depending on magnitude and the color of the circles changes based on depth of the earthquake. 
If you click on the circles you will be given the depth and magnitude of the earthquake as well as the location. 

I attempted two different ways of doing a legend but both times the location function was throwing an error and I decided to work on project 2 iunstead of worrying about a legend. 

Have a nice day.
